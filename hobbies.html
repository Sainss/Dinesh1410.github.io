				<dd>A movie, also called a film, motion picture or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon.We can get information <abbr title="as soon as possible">ASAP</abbr> This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of <abbr title="Computergenerated imagery">CGI</abbr> and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. The word "cinema" is often used to refer to the industry of films and filmmaking or to the art of filmmaking itself. The contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences to communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.</dd></dl>

				<dd>A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of ink, paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.</dd></dl>

				<dd>A video game is an electronic game that involves human interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device,but it now implies any type of display device that can produce two- or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D" title="3-D image" class="color" target="_blank">three-dimensional images</a>.

			<li><dl><dt id="sleep"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep" title="Sleep" class="color" target="_blank">sleeping</a>!(who doesn't like it)</dt>
				<dd>Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles, and reduced interactions with surroundings.It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but is more easily reversed than the state of hibernation or of being comatose. Mammalian sleep occurs in repeating periods, in which the body alternates between two highly distinct modes known as non-REM and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep" title="Rapid Eye Movement Sleep" class="color" target="_blank">REM sleep</a>. REM stands for "rapid eye movement" but involves many other aspects including virtual paralysis of the body.</dd></dl>
